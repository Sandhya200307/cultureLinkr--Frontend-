Frontend Challenge (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
Task: Create a simple web page with a form that includes the following fields: name, email, and message. When the user submits the form, display a success message without refreshing the page (use JavaScript or a front-end framework if you're comfortable).
Provide a link to your solution (Github/Codepen).
Note: Using a framework is preferable.
